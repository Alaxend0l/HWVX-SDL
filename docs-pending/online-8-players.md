# Online: 8 players, and mods (for HWVX-SDL/README.md "Online play", or docs/xdl-format/README.md §10.5 next to "online choices by id")

Sessions take up to 8 players (NET_PROTOCOL 3) in Battle and Joyride; Drag Race takes 4 at
most (the user's decision: its worlds have the retail grid of 4). The host's mode screen
refuses Drag Race with more than 4 in the lobby and says "Drag Race: 4 players at most";
players past 4 wait in the lobby. The retail game has 4 player ports; online:

- Ports 5-8 are human players from extra pool slots (PlayerManager.c), with their car, item and
  round results kept past the code variables' 4 (GameSettings.c, online only).
- Spawns, in this order: a retail player spawn nobody in the game has (so 4 players or fewer
  always start exactly where the retail game puts them, whatever their ports), a Battle
  world's AI spawns (AI is off online), then a spot of ours near one of the world's 4, found
  from the world's collision for the largest car, Surfin' School Bus (collision box 9 x 27):
  ground under all four corners as high as the spawn's, no wall within its half-diagonal plus
  a margin, its box 2-8 units clear of every other spawn's, in plain reach of the spawn.
  Joyride's single spawn gets 7 such spots around it. Offline nothing changes.
- Scripts: a trigger or action whose car list names all of the world's 4 player spawns
  (airboxes, control on/off, teleports) includes players 5-8.
- The round summary has four rows; with players 5-8 in the game it shows P1-P4 and P5-P8 in
  turns (3 s each). No auto-advance online in Battle and Drag Race (unchanged).
- Mods: each machine sends a fingerprint of its enabled mods (FNV-1a of "id@version" in load
  order, plus names) in MSG_HELLO on joining. A client whose mods differ from the host's
  leaves with "Mods differ. Host: ... Here: ..."; the host leaves it out of games and shows
  "Player N has other mods" in the lobby. No mods on both sides: they match.
- A registered track goes in MSG_SETUP by id, with the level of the track it is made from
  for a machine without it (levels past a script's own are numbered by each ids.lock).
- The round time travels as read (ms): the menus set it in 5-minute steps, and setting the
  read value again multiplied it (a bug before 8 players).
